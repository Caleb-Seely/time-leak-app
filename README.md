# TimeLeak

TimeLeak is an Android application that automatically tracks and analyzes your daily screen time and app usage patterns. The app runs in the background, collecting usage statistics and syncing them to Firebase Firestore daily, even when the app is not actively being used. This allows users to gain insights into their digital habits and make informed decisions about their screen time usage.

## Features (Planned)
