# Proguard rules (commit if customized, ignore if purely default/auto-generated)
# Typically, you *want* to commit proguard-rules.pro if you've made custom rules.
# If it's just the default, you *could* ignore it.
# Assuming you customize it, I'll remove it from ignore for now.
# If you don't customize it and want to ignore it:
# proguard-rules.pro
