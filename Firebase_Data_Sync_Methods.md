# Firebase Data Synchronization Methods - TimeLeak App

## Overview
The TimeLeak app employs a clean, focused synchronization strategy to ensure reliable data transfer to Firebase Firestore. This document outlines the streamlined sync methods, their timings, triggers, and techniques used throughout the application.

## 🔄 Sync Methods Summary

| Method | Trigger | Timing | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Daily Midnight Sync** | Scheduled | 11:59 PM daily | Every 24 hours | Primary daily data backup |
| **Immediate Sync** | User Authentication | Instant | Once per login | Initial data upload after login |
| **Manual Debug Sync** | User Action | On-demand | As needed | Development & troubleshooting |

## 📱 Detailed Sync Methods

### 1. **Immediate Sync** (Authentication-Triggered)
**Location:** `SyncScheduler.scheduleImmediateSync()`, `AuthViewModel.signInWithCredential()`

**Timing:** Triggered immediately upon successful user authentication

**Purpose:** Ensures new users or returning users get their data synced right away

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
// Triggered in AuthViewModel after successful login
SyncScheduler.scheduleImmediateSync(context)

// Uses OneTimeWorkRequest with immediate execution
val immediateSyncRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UsageSyncWorker>()
    .setConstraints(constraints)
    .setInputData(Data.Builder().putBoolean("is_immediate_sync", true).build())
    .build()
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Highest priority sync
- ✅ Runs immediately after authentication
- ✅ No delay (immediate execution)
- ✅ Network required
- ✅ Battery optimization friendly

---

### 2. **Daily Midnight Sync** (Primary 24-Hour Schedule)
**Location:** `DailyMidnightScheduler`, `DailyMidnightSyncWorker`

**Timing:** Every day at 11:59 PM

**Purpose:** Main daily data backup and synchronization

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
// Uses OneTimeWorkRequest chaining for reliability
fun scheduleNext1159PMSync(context: Context) {
    val delay = calculateDelayToNext1159PM()
    val syncRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<DailyMidnightSyncWorker>()
        .setInitialDelay(delay, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        .build()
}
```

**Key Features:**
- 🌙 **Target Time:** 11:59 PM daily
- 🔄 **Self-Perpetuating:** Each sync schedules the next one
- 🛡️ **Fault-Tolerant:** Reschedules even if current sync fails
- 🎯 **Precise Timing:** Calculates exact delay to next 11:59 PM
- ✅ **Self-Healing:** Maintains daily schedule automatically

**Why 11:59 PM?**
- Captures full day's usage data
- Low device activity period
- Better network availability
- Consistent daily rhythm

---

### 3. **Manual Debug Sync** (Developer Tool)
**Location:** `DebugInfoCard` component

**Timing:** On-demand via debug panel

**Purpose:** Development, testing, and troubleshooting

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
// Manual sync button in debug panel
Button(
    onClick = {
        scope.launch {
            val stats = repository.getLast24HoursUsageStats()
            if (stats != null) {
                firestoreRepository.uploadUsageData(context, stats)
                onSyncMessage("Successfully synced to database!")
            }
        }
    }
) { Text("Sync Now") }
```

**Access:** Debug panel (gear icon) → "Sync Now" button

**Characteristics:**
- 🛠️ Development tool
- 🚀 Instant execution
- 📊 Real-time feedback
- 🔍 Useful for testing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### WorkManager Foundation
All sync methods use Android's WorkManager for reliable background execution:

```kotlin
// Common constraints across sync methods
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
    .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
    .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(false)  // Allow when battery is low
    .setRequiresCharging(false)       // Don't require charging
    .setRequiresDeviceIdle(false)     // Don't require idle
    .build()
```

### Core Sync Worker
All sync operations use `UsageSyncWorker` which:
- ✅ Validates usage permissions
- ✅ Confirms user authentication
- ✅ Fetches last 24-hour usage data
- ✅ Uploads to Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Records successful sync time
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

### Data Pipeline
```
Usage Stats Collection → Data Processing → Firebase Upload → Success Tracking
                    ↓                    ↓                  ↓
            [UsageStatsRepository] → [FirestoreRepository] → [SharedPreferences]
```

## 📊 Sync Data Structure

### Primary Data (`UsageData`)
```kotlin
data class UsageData(
    val userId: String,
    val phoneNumber: String,
    val date: Date,
    val totalScreenTime: Long,
    val socialMediaTime: Long,
    val entertainmentTime: Long,
    val goalTime: Long?
)
```

### App-Level Data (`AppUsageData`) - Currently Disabled
```kotlin
// Commented out for privacy reasons
data class AppUsageData(
    val packageName: String,
    val usageTimeMillis: Long,
    val appName: String,
    val category: String
)
```

---

## 🛡️ Reliability & Error Handling

### Retry Logic
- **Exponential Backoff:** 15-30 minute intervals
- **Multiple Attempts:** WorkManager handles retries automatically
- **Network Failures:** Automatic retry when network returns
- **Authentication Failures:** Graceful failure with next-day retry

### Failure Recovery
```kotlin
// Even failed syncs schedule the next attempt
catch (e: Exception) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Sync failed: ${e.message}", e)
    // Still schedule next sync to maintain daily cadence
    DailyMidnightScheduler.scheduleNext1159PMSync(context)
    return Result.failure(outputData)
}
```

### Health Monitoring
- **Last Sync Time:** Tracked in SharedPreferences
- **WorkManager Status:** Real-time work state monitoring
- **Debug Diagnostics:** Comprehensive status reporting
